# Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

- We have to first traverse to the bottom of the `left subtree`, then go up to the `root`, while checking the for a `right subtree` of the `left subtree`
- After the `Root node` we check the `right subtree` and go to the furthest `left subtree` in the `right subtree`

## Approaches

#### Using DFS (Depth-First-Search)

#### Using Stacks (LIFO)
